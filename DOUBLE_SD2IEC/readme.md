A Dual SD2IEC drive based on the Shadow Wolf 1.2 design.

This design is part of the TT8BG project but can be used stand alone as well.

In standalone mode two 6 pin DIN connectors provide a pass thru for the IEC, just like the original commodore diskdrives.

Firmware and flash instructions can be found in https://github.com/rjacobs1969/TT8BG/tree/master/SD2IEC 
You will have to flash each Atmega1284 serperatly using it's corresponding 6 pin ISP header on the board
